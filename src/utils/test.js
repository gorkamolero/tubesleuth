  text: "Ever wonder where modern mysticism got its roots? Three words, Hermes, Trismegistus. This ancient figure's teachings, whispered through the corridors of time, echo in today's occult and New Age movements. But what if everything you believed was rooted in secrets, codes hidden in plain sight, leading those who seek to a different reality? Followers of Hermes, the thrice great, seek the truth behind the veil, as above, so below. This knowledge, shrouded in mystery, paved the way for alchemy, astrology, and even the enigmatic tarot. It's time to question what's been told. What if what you've been told is all a lie? Follow to discover the truth, and perhaps you, too, will uncover the secrets of Hermes' legacy.",
